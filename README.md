# Flink Sliding Window with Kafka

## There are 3  different packages in this project.

```Please note this is just a test project so errors might be there, we are fixing it and will keep on updating the repository.```

### Tools used:
- IntelliJ - IDE
- Apache Kafka
- Apache Flink

First Connecting Kafka with Flink. Sending Data through Kafka with a topic, and later receving the data on FlinkKafkaConsumer. Applying Flink Sliding Window to check the outcome.

There are different Data Collectors that are used for testing purpose.
Some Data Collectors are used directly onto Flink Window without usage of Kafka directly,
as to check if it is giving outcome that we needed.
